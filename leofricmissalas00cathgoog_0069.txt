that purpose. The list is an appalling one, both in its character and dimensions, and yet we are

‘Dei famula' to a certain bishop, of whose name only the initial letter L is given. It contains
a request for the bishop’s prayers, and lays down directions as to prayer for the dead.

Adsis, the fourth daughter of William the Conqueror and Maud, after the death of her
husband, Stephen, Count of Blois, in 1102, entered the Benedictine monastery of Marsigny
(Marcheniacum) in France, where she died in 1137. The decrees of two abbots of this monastery
are referred to in the course of the letter, viz. Ricardus, abbot from 1090-1100, and Odolo, abbot
1100-1102. The letter must therefore have been written after 1102 and before 1137, and cannot
