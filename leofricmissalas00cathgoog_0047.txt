xl inhumiles.

(f) The absence of all Sequences; the few which do occur having been added by a later hand.
Their invention is attributed t0 Notker‚a monk of St. Gall, †911, and they began to make
their appearance in Sacramentaries in the tenth century.

(g) The allusion t0 diptychs in a Missa Generalis pro uiuis et defunctis :-

‘ Et animas famulorum famularumque tuarum, omnium uidelicet fidelium catholicorum
orthodoxorum, quorum commemorationem agimus, et quorum corpora circum quaque requiescent,
uel quorum nomina ante sanctum altare tuum scripta adesse uidentur, electorum tuorum iungere
digneris consortio’ (p. 192). The phrase is repeated in the following Secreta ¹.

(h) The retention of certain early forms'of nomenclaturez-

i. The title of ‘Octauis Domini' instead of ‘Circumcisio Domini,' for June 1. The
latter title is used in B (p. 23).

ii. The inverted enumeration of the Sundays in Advent‚ beginning with Ebdomada iv,
ante natale Domini. ⁸

iii. The title ‘Dominica uacat' for the Sunday after the sabbatum in xii. Lectionibus

inv· 79. 129)-
iv. ‘Pascha Annotina’ (p. 105, q. v.).

(i) The invocation of several eighth-century saints in the Litany on pp. cop-10, the latest
of them being St. Opportuna, abbess of Seez in Normandy, † 769.

Monostic character of Leosric A. Like other Sacramentaries‚ Leofric A seems t0 be monastic
in its origin, and t0 have been written in the scriptorium, and first used at the altar of a Bene·
dictine monastery. ,

This may be inferred from the ‘Missa monachorum propria’ (fol. 227 b), which a later English
hand has specialized and appropriated by inserting in the Collect the words—‘ Et sancto Benedicto
confessore tuo‚’—and by writing an additional Collect on the margin, in which the name of
the same saint is introduced.

There are two festivals connected with St. Benedict's name,—

xii. Kal. Apr. Depositio St. Benedicti, Abbatis (p. 139).
v. Id. Tul. Translatio St. Benedicti Abbatis (p. 149).

The latter being distinguished as one of the festivals of the third class (p. xxxv.)

There are also a considerable number of monastic saints invoked in the Litany on fol. 266 a,
(p- 209)-

b 22. Locality os Leofric A. The Roman stations are, as usual, entered, and preserve a proof
of its Gregorian or Roman origin. Such stations as ‘Ad sanctam mariam trans Tiberim’ (p. 80),
‘Ad pontem Molbi' (p. 107), ‘Ad sanctam mariam maiorem' (p. 128), etc, can only point t0
one locality. ,But the copy was written in France and contains many Gallican additions,
and exhibits many signs of Gallican influence. The character of the handwriting and of the
omamentation, as already described ², would be alone sufficient to establish its non-Anglican origin.
An approximation to the French style is said to be occasionally found in tenth-century E‘nglish
documents as in the Charter of Eadgar for a new minster at Winchester, A.D. 960, but even here
the lengthened letters e, f, g, r, s, w, unmistakably betray an English scribe ³. In the present MS.a
contrast is constantly afforded between the two styles, by the additions of the Epistles and Gospels,
and occasionally Sequences‚ on the margin by a later English hand, and by small alterations,
as on fol. 187 b, where quite a different ‘r' has been written by an Anglo·Saxon hand over the
word ‘sacis' from which it had been accidentally omitted by the original scribe. But, apart
