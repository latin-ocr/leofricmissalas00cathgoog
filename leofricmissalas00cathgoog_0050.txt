· (9) A few 21 2122 prayers afford internal evidence of warmer climate than, and a different
natural produce from, that of England, eg. :-

1. The Benedictio mrae (p. 152). ,
2. The Benedictio uuae vel rabae (p. 224).
3. The Benedictio uini (p. 224).

Νο. 2, inserted in the Mass on Aug. 6 has got copied from its French original into the
Sarum Missal, but can only have originated like 2 and 3 in 2 vine-growing country.

223. The second part of the Leofric Missal in point of date is an English Kalendar which
we designate as Leofric B, and which Leofric, or whoever else brought the Anas-Cambray book
(Leofric A) into England, prefixed to it.

The absence 21 any original connection between the Sacramentary and the Kalendar is
shown by the entire change of style of writing andos ornamentation, as well as by the fact
that there are seven Masses in the Sacramentary (Leoiric Α) in connection with festivals not
named in the Kalendar, and 147 Saints Days noted in the Kalendar for which there is no

, corresponding Mass in the Sacramentary.

The Kalendas, which is preceded by two pages, and followed by twenty-seven pages, of
elaborate Paschal Tables, Solar and Lunar calculatione, etc, is written on a fine vellum in gather-
ings of eight leaves, not signed. The last gethering wants two leaves, and its three last pages
are occupied by miscellaneous matter belonging to Leolric C. There are thirty-four lines on
a page, on fine lines niled from as many extreme marginal priclrings. Of the horizontal lines
only the topmost and bottommost are ruled across the peges, the rest being confined within
a framework formed by at least two, often more, perpendicular lines.

§24 Ornamentation. On 121. 492, 2 large human hand with outstretched fingere, and with
blue clothing on the wrist‚ is being extended from the clouds. 12 12 labelled ‘Dextera Domini,’
and various Paschal dates are written along the fingers. It is enclosed within a foliated framework.
Two somewhat angular and contorted human figures are skilfully introduced into the lower
right and left hand corners, and appear to be reading with astonishment the inscription on ⁸
the hand.

On fol. 49b there is an allegorical figure 21 1112, crowned, with across as a sceptre in the
left hand, and with a scroll depending from both 1222222, which are extended for its display.
This figure is probably intended to represent our Lord as the Prince of Life. Its red and blue
drapery, like the dresses 21 the figures on 121. 492, 12 arranged in fiuttering 12122, in the style
which is peculiarly characteristic 21 AngloSaxon art in the tenth century. Above and on
both sides of the figure and on the scroll are verses or numbers connected with the chances
of life.

On fol. 5oa there is a representation of Death, or of Satan as the Prince of Death. The
figure is nude, save for a shaggy girdle round the loins. A pair of horns spring upwards from
the head. The enlarged ears fiap like leaves. The hair of the head developes outwards into six
dragous, three on the right, three on the left hand side. A pair. of wings is fitted to the shoulders.
There is hair on the chin and chesn· The elbows, finees, fingere,¹ and toes are fumished with
claws or spurs. Both hands are extended, displaying 2 222211. Above the figure, on both
sides 21 12, on the scroll in its hands, and on the diamond·shaped shield in the left hand
lower comer are lines or figures connected with the chances of death, sickness, success in busi-
ness, etc. The design is borrowed from, and 12 described as, ‘The sphere 21 Apuleius‚’ the
well-known author of ‘The Golden Ass’ This ‘sphere,' varying somewhat from its present
