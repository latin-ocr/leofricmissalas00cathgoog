saints. The greater number oi these Festivals are the common property oi early Christendom, and
commemorate martyre in the early heathen, especially in the Decian and Diocletian, persecutions.
They are oi all nationalities, European and Asiatic, although, as might be expected in a Western
Kalendar, Western names preponderate.

Nothing would be gained ior our present purpose by enumerating those saints, who form
the common stock on which all Kalendars are more or less based. It is only when we come
to later additions that light is thrown on the real character and nationality oi any Kalendar.
On arranging the names ol the saints according to the centuries in which they died, it is found
that, with iour exceptions¹ every saint alter A. D. 500 is connected with Great Britain and Ireland
or France. These exceptions are St. Benedict (Mar. 21), with his sister St. Scholastica (Feb. 10),
veneration ior whom naturally passed into England along with the adoption of the Benedictine
Rule; St. Gregory (March 12, 30), the pope to whose lorethought the English Church owed its first
existence3 and Anastasius (Jan. 22), an Assyrian martyrol great same.
