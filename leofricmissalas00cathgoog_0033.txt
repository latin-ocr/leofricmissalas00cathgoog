dress of monks. Indeed the latter was expressly forbidden ¹. Otherwise it seems to have
differed from a conventual rule, only in nominally allowing, what it practically took away, the
right of private property ². Equal‘rations of food and drink were served out daily, and clothing
once a year, by an officer appointed for that purpose ³. There was a common dinner table, and
a common dormitory⁴. They were bound to keep all the ‚canonical hoursl, and their fasts
were severe and long. From Martinmas to Christmas, Nov.11t0 Dec. 25, they might eat no
flesh‚ no'r taste anything at all before 3 p. m.⁶ They were not to have wives, and were to
avoid all women as far as possible, and unmarried women like snakes ⁷. Severe penalties

were assigned to trivial offences, and all, except the aged and the exalted in rank, were

subject to corporal punishment ⁸. It is hardly to be wondered at that William of Malmes·

bury should describe this system as contrary to the custom of the English, and that, in spite

of the personal piety of Leofric, his attempt to plant this foreign rule on an English soil was

³ fallu? liaving now described the life, character, and 'policy of Bishop Leofric, and the phase

through which the Church of England was passing in the reign of Edward the Confessor, under his
guidance and that of other foreign prelates, we pass on to describe more particularly the servic'e
book which he bequeathed to his cathedral, and which therefore has long passed under the
name of the Leofric Missal.

In its present condition it is a stout quarto volume, consisting of 378 leaves of vellum,
8in. κ 6in.‚ exclusive of six blank modern paper ily-leaves, which belong to the same date as the
' brown Russian leather binding, which it received from some Oxford book-binder about a century
ago. The first of the 378 vellum leaves is blank and is not included in the modern pagination,
in Arabic numerals, by which the last folio is numbered 377. This numeration has been retained
for the sake of harmony with the numerous references to this MS. in the works of Dr. Rock,
Mr. Maskell, and other Liturgical writers.

The volume, in its present form, is of a very complex character ¹⁰, and consists of three main
and distinct divisione, which, for convenience sake may be designated as Leofric A, B, C.

' Leofric A, which forms the bulk of the volume, is a Gregorian Sacramentary, written in

’ Lotharingia early in the tenth century.

Leofric B is an Anglo·Saxon Kalendar with Paschal Tables, etc, written in England circ.
nu. 970.

Leofric C consists of a heterogeneous collection of Masses, Manumissions, historical state-
ments, etc, written in England partly in the tenth, partly in the eleventh centuries.

The complexity of the volume is increased by the confused arrangement of the leaves belong·
ing to these separate parts, and to the occupation of blank leaves or parts of leaves by entries in
later handwritings. It is impossible to say when the present dislocation of leaves began,
and how far it is due to the Oxford binder; nor is it possible to reproduce exactly the original
arrangement, some leaves having been lost, as is evideut from the incomplete gatherings and
from the abrupt endings of the text on foll. 16b, 211b, etc.
