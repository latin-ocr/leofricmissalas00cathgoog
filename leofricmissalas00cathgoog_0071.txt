An exception to this general rule occurred on Good Friday, when all were bidden to receive
the communion, under one kind only, from the consecrated Host which had been reserved from
Maundy Thursday ¹.

1 50. Sick or dying people were communicated in both kinds, not separately, but conjointly,
by intinction. The priest was ordered to dip the Host in wine, or water, and to administer it with
a formula which implied the presence 01 both kinds ². The permission to substitute water ior wine
is one of a class os objectionable directions sometimes found in mediaeval Rituals³, of a date prior
to the Council of Constance, which expressly ordered communion in one kind only ⁴.

(51. The solemn rite of the episcopal benediction pronounced by the Anglo·Saxon bishop
in the course of the Canon, immediately after the fraction of the Host, and before the kiss of peace.
These Benedictions consisted os three variable clauses, having reference to the festival for which
they were provided, and to each of which the people responded ‘Amen' and of two invariable
clauses, which, as they are seldom ¹written in full, are given here :-

‘Quod ipse prestare dignetur cuius regnum et'imperium sine fine permanet in secula seculorum.
Amen!

‘Benedictio dei patris, et filii, et spiritus sancti, et pax domini sit semper uobiscum. Resp.
Etcum spiritu tuo.³

They were in use on every Sunday and Greater Festival‚ and were either written in separate
volumen hence called Benedictionais, to be handed to the bishop when the proper time arrived ⁶, or
they were accumulated together at the commencement or close of the Sacramentary ⁶, or they were
dispersed‚ as here, throughout the volume, under the heads of the various Masses to which they
belonged ⁷.

This episcopal benediction occupied a similar position in the Gallican and Mozarabic Liturgies,
and was perpetuated in England by the Sarum Use up to 1549 ⁸, and in various mediaeval French
Uses⁹. It never formed part of the Roman Liturgy except where it was borrowed from one 01
these sources. In the Leofric Missal, as in Bod, Benedictions are wanting for the Sundays after
Pentecost.

(52. Every greater festival, and almost every minor holy day and separate Missa, had its
ProperPreface. There are several hundred Prefaces in the present volume ; a number which has
been reduced to ten in the present Roman, and to five in the present Anglican rite. These Prefaces
are sometimes of great beauty, sometimes adorned with well-expressed antithesis, or with quaint
conceits of thought, sometimes couched in language which perpetuates the memory of the lise or
character of a saint. In illustration of these remarks the reader is referred to the Prefaces for the
Friday after the Third Sunday in Lent‚ embodying our Lord’s interview with the woman at the
well of Samaria (page 84); to that for the invention of the cross (page 141); for the common of
virgin martyrs (page 174); for many departed ones (page 197) ; for St. Cuthbert’s day (page 205).
