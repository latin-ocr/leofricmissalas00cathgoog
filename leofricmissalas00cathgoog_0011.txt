‘To the shame ol this country, much ol what belongs to our ancient ecclesiastical history has
been snatched lrorn lorgetlulness, and given to the world through the prese, not by Englishmen nor
by English patronage, but by foreigners, such as those truly great and truly learned ecclesiastics,
Mabillon, Martene, Muratori, and the Bollandists. 1 Let us, however, hope that a new and a brighter
day may dawn upon England; and while she learns to appheciate her own vast wealth in the
remains ol her ancient literature, she will hearten lorwards all those among her sons who are now
ready and wishlul to toil upon the national stores, and bring to light these islands' literary riches
which still lie hidden in manuscnptsss-Rocx, 7712 Churck os our Fothers, iii. r. ¹9¹·
