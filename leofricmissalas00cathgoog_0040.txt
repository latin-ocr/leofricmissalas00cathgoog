Muratori asserts that nothing is known, and that nothing can be known, about the character
of the Roman Liturgy during the first iour centuries alter Christ ¹. As a matter of fact our un-
certainty, if not our ignorante, as to its exact nature extends to a much later date ². Such phrases
as ‘the Gregorian Sacramentary‚’ ‘the Gregorian Can0n‚’ etc.‚ in common use among Liturgical
writers, lead ¹the ordinary reader into the supposition that we have contemporary evidence about its
character and contents‚ butan inspection of the above list will establish two important points3
firstly, that we have no surviving documentary evidence as to the contents of the Gregorian
Liturgy earlier than the reign of Charlemagne ς secondly, that all the important extant codices,
which have been printed or collated‚ were written north os the Alps, and mostly within the
geographical boundaries oi France‚ ii we may use that term in the extended sense which it bore
in the earlier partos the ninth century³.

An immense number ol codices were written at th'at time by order of Charlemagne‚ and under
the sostering care oi Aleum, foreign copies being introduced into France in large numbers sor the
purpose of transcription, especially from England, where the Roman Liturgy had been in use since

the seventh century.
