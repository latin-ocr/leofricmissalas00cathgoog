In points where the arrangement of ancient MSS. varies, or where readings differ, Leofric A
follows the Codex Othobonianus (O), generally agreeing with it as against the Codex Vati·
canus ii. (V).

The following are among the more important illustrations of such agreements and differ-
entes:-

(a) Leofrie A contains over 200 proper prefaces‚ most 01 which are to be found in O.
Here, as in Bod. and E, they are horrowed from a Gallican source. The Roman Sacramentary
in its Gregorian form, of which in this respect V is a sample‚ contained only eight such prcfaces ¹.

(b) It contains a large number of the triple episcopal benedictions which, according to the
’ custom of the ancient churches of Gaul and Spain, were pronounced by the bishop after the
Lord's Prayer and before the Communion. These did not form part of the Roman rite, and
are not found in V. Where they are found, as here and in Bod. and E, they are importations
from a Gallican source ².

(c) The opening words of the Introit and its Psalmus, the Gradual (or Tract) with its Verses,
the Offertorium, and the Communio are written ‘prima manu’ on the margin. T hose 01 the
Epistle and Gospel and Sequences were added afterwards. This unusual arrangement is also
found in O (but without the Psalmus and Versus), and in Codex Theodericensis‚ i. Its object is

in 00 isolated way, as 'Orationes super populum,’ in the Sundays at the close 01 V. by its Gallican scribe by way 01 appendix.
