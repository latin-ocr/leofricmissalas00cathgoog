the ninth century, and points to the soundness of the conclusion, which, chielly on palaeogmphical
considerations, assigns it to the first half of the tenth century ¹.

(a) The arrangement of the seven opening ‘Missae Votivae’ for the seven days of the week,
p. 176. The votive Mass ‘de Sancta Trinitate’ and the six following Messes were compiled by
Alcuin († 804) and assigned by him to the different days of the week. There is a slight
variation in the wording of their titles and in the order iu which they occur in early Missals, .
as may bc seen by the following Table:-

DieDom. Desencte Trinitate.
Fer. ii. Pro peccetis. Desanctu sapientis. De sapientia.
Fer. iii. Ad postulandamgelice'suifragia. De sancta caritate. De postulando dono Spiritus sancti.

De cordis emundatione per Spiritum
sanctum postulanda.

Fer. v. De charitate. Ad angelornm suffragia postulanda. De caritate,
Fer. vi. De sancta cruos. inhonore sanctae crucis. Decruce.
Sub. De sunm Maria lu honorem sanetae Mariae. De sancta Maria. ·

Fer. iv. De sancte sapientia. Ad postulanda angelica suffragia.

(b) The separate commemoration of the Apostles. Till the eighth century, they were jointly
commemorated on June 19, in the West, and on June 30, in the East of Christendom². Hence
there isa good deal of uncertainty and variety in the wording, etc. of these Missae. A trace'
of this older arrangement might seem to be found in the title written for July 6, ‘In octauis
Apostolorum' (p. 149), but the Collect refers only to St.1>eter and St. Paul.

(c) The presence of the following octaves and Vigils2-

The octave of no festival other than Christmas‚ Easter, and Pentecost was universal in the
first eight centuries. The octaves of Saints Days are spolren of as unsettled by Amalarius,
†815³. The vigil of the festival of the Assumption (together with its octave) was ordered to
be kept by Leo 1v, in 847.

(d) The presence within the canon of the late clause, ‘Pro quibus tibi offerimus vel’ (p. όο).

(e) The absence of a ‘Dominica’ or ‘Festum Sanctae Trinitatis,' the institution of which is
assigned to Alexander III (1159-81).
