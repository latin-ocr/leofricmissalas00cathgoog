of King Edward († 978) was inserted in the Kalendar on March 18, by a Witenagemot held under
Ethelred, A.D. 1008 ¹. That of St. Dunstan († 988) by a Witenagemot held at Winchester under

But the claims of Rome to interfere in these and other matters grew apace, and submissiou
to them was secured hythe foreignerS, in birth or sentiment, who in the eleventh century were
selected by Edward the Confessor to fill the chief ecclesiastical posts in England. We can trace
such a tendency in the policy of Leofric. He considered the Pope’s leave necessary before
shifting his See from Crediton to Exetcr‚ and deferentially applied for it ³. Considerable altera·
tions had taken place in Roman office books since the time of Charlemagne, and Leofric introduced
foreign devotional books into his diocese. Among the Psalters, in the list of books previously
quoted, is one arranged according to the Roman mode of chanting ⁴. The present Missal‚

as far as the larger portion of it is concerned, is not English in origin, only in use. It was .

written in Lotharingia⁵ and was doubtless brought over to England by Leofric on his first
arrival on English shores, and then, with considerable English additions, made one of the principal
books iu use at Exeter cathedralt On transferring his See to Exeter in 1050, he ejected
the nuns⁷ who had hitherto occupied the monastery of St. Peter, which was given to him over
their heads by the king, and introduced for the first time (virtually) regular canons to under·
take the services of the new cathedral⁸. This body is believed to have consisted of twenty-four
canons and twenty-four vicars, if, in the absence of contemporary authority, we may trust the
assertions of later documents connected with the cathedral. Much later on iu his episcopate
we are told of his exempting the priory on St. Michael’s Mount from episcopal jurisdiction⁹,
and ejecting the old body of secular canons from St Germain’s and introducing a body of regular
canons iu their place. Such at least is the description of his action at St. Germain's in a document
written in the thirty-second year of Edward 111, and printed by Dugdale ¹⁰3 but it may be con·
jectured that Leofric acted at St. Germain's as he did at Exeter, where he introduced aud enforced
upon his newly-created canons the severe and, as William of Malmesbury terms it, the un-English
rule which he brought with him from Lotharingia ¹¹. This was the famous rule of Chrodegang,
Bishop of Metz‚ 743-766‚ which sought to impose almost all the severities of monastic life upon
those who submitted to it, although it did not allow them to use the name or to wear the
