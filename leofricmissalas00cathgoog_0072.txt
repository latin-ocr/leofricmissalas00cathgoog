inuehuntur. lxv

There is much beauty also in the language of many of the Benedictions¹, and Collectsi, etc.
An objectionable element is the presence of many and lengthy exorcisms, which have now been
wisely removed in part from Roman, and entirely from Anglican offices. They include statements
about the possession of inanimate things as well as animate beings by the devil (pp 233, 235,
257); lengthy enumerations of the various parts of the body, and of the different diseases to which
they are subject (pp. 234-5, 2 57); prayers for delivery from the attacks of monsters, and from the
. powers of necromancy³. ,

With this exception, the Leofric Missal is a repertory of ancient and beautiful prayers, applicable
for every festival and in almost any emergency, which, it is hoped, may be borrowed for use, or at
least may serve for models of composition, whenever, from time to time, devotions for special occa·
sions are put forth by authority in the Church of England ⁴. ’

The orthography of the MS. has been retained throughout, but in the Latin passages the
punctuation has been modernized‚ and capital letters have been introduced after full stops, as well
as retained in places where they occur in the MS.

In Anglo·Saxon passages the original punctuation and division of words have been retained
Letters in Italics are represented in the MS. by the sign of abbreviation or contraction. The
modern (w) has been substituted for the Anglo·Saxon (h).

Prepositions‚ pronouns, and conjunctions, which are frequently written in the MS. close td
the following word, have been separated in print, except where a sort of compound word has been
produced, as ‘impresenti’ etc.

The ae and oe of the diphthongs, which have been printed throughout in combination (ae, oe),
are separated in the Latin and combined in the Anglo·Saxon passages of the MS.

The imperfectioris of the MS. and errors os the scribe have been faithfully retained, as eg.
in the lowest line of p. 23, where the xii and vii are clerical errors for xvi and viii. On p. 46 the
numbers within the concentric circles are faithful reproductions of the numbers as they exist in the
MS. at present, not of the numbers as they should be, if correctly written or printed. It has not
been thought worth while, as a general rufe, to call attention to such irregularities in the text⁶.'
