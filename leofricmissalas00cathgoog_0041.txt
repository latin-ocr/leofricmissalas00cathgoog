The unusual demand was caused by the abolition of the ancient and national Liturgy of France
by imperial authority, and by· the need of copies oi the innovating Roman rite which was to take
its place. Leofric A is one of the numerous codices, which in the tenth, as before in the ninth
century, were being elaborated in the scriptoria oi French monasteries, and which owed their exist·
ence to the Romanizing policy of the Carlovingian dynasty.

Its publication will throw no fresh light on the character of the ancient Liturgy oi France3 its
interest lies chiefly in its being the first published text of a Liturgy actually in use in an English
cathedral before the Conquest. ·

p 14. Handwriting os A. The MS. is written throughout in a pure Caroline minuscule hand·
writing‚ in letters about an eighth of an inch in height Only one scribe has been employed, but
his handwriting exhibits occasional signs of slovenliness towards the close of his work, as if he was
wearied with the length of his task. .

ᾧ 15. Gatlrerings, Rulingos A. The somewhat coarse dark vellum on which it is written is
arranged in twenty gatherings of eight leaves, five of ten leaves, two of twelve leaves, and a few
parts of gatherings or single leaves. There are no signatores. The vellum is ruled with a sharp
point on one side only. There are twenty-one lines on a page asfar as fol. 243 b, after which
twenty-three lines begin frequently to make their appearance ; the ruled lines, rather more than a
quarterof an inch apart, are confined between single horizontal boundary lines across the full length
of the page; and double boundary perpendicular lines, drawn from the top horizontal line to the
bottom oi the page. These perpendicular lines lie three-eighths of an inch apart, and contain the
ordinary capital letters between them.

ς 16. Ornamentatr'on os Α. The Sursum corda on fol. 60 a, the first page of the Sacramentary
(from ‘per omnia’ to ‘iustum est'), is written in uncial letters a quanter of an inch high. Ten such
lines, written alternately in red and black ink, occupy the whole page, with the interstices of the
letters filled up with patches of gold, and of red 'and blue paint.

The next four pages (60 b to 62 a), containing the ordinary Preface and the opening words of
the Canon (from ‘Vere dignum' to ‘cultoribus'), are richly ornamented in the Franco-Saxon style of
the end of the ninth and beginning oi the tenth centuries.

The first two peges exhibit a broad golden framework, such as is usual in the case of the Euse-
bian Canons. The arches spring from pillars with foliated bases and capitals. Their groundwork
is gold with vermilion outlines, their centres being filled up with light interiaced work on a dark
ground. In the centre of fol. 60 b is a large U of similar work, with two large birds' heads as ter-
minations of its lower centre, which is bifurcated upwards; the letters E R E are written above it,
and ‘Dignum' below it, in a light green oblong framework, all these letters being of considerable
size, of gold edged with vermilion.

On fol. 61 a the words of the Preface are written in minuscule gold letters, on nine horizontal
panels, once purple, but now nearly black, edged with vermilion. and filling up the centre of the
page within the arched frameworks.

Pages 61 b, 62 a e'xhibit broad square frameworks with smaller squares at the four comers, re-
sembling in their colouring and execution the arches on iolios 60b and 61 a. The centre of fol. 61b
is occupied by a gigantic T, with its stem terminating in two dragons' heads, with red outstretched
tongues. A large E in a dark fancy framework is placed on the right-hand side of the stem of the
T, and ‘igitur’ at its base. These letters are large gold uncials edged with vermilion. On fol. 62 a
the next words of the Canon are written in gold minuscule letters, on seven dark purple (nearly
black) horizontal bands, occupying the centre of the page within the framework.

The only omamentation in the rest of Leofric A is spent upon initial letters. These, which are
written in plain red and black alternately, are about threesseighths of an inch high, at the commence-
