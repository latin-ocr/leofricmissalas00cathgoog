the govemed (or following) word; so much so that occasionally absorption and assimilation take
place, e. g. exion [=ex syon], imperpetuam, impreciosis, impresenti, impresepe.

§ 11. carelessness os the scribes. Some of the orthographical irregularities in the above list may
be merely due to the carelessness os the various writers oi this MS, which, though by no means
excessive, exhibita itsels in the following ways :—

By omission (a) ol the markos abbreviation or contraction3 of aletter or letters, as ‘ omnipontia’
lor ‘omnipotentia’ (fol. 291b); oi a syllable, as ‘esse’ for ‘praeesse’ (fol. 34 b); os a word, as
‘tribue’ (iol. 24 a); ol the marginal entries oi catchwords in A (sol. 73 b, 74 b, etc.); of the title os a
prayer, as Postcommunio (fol. 17 b). The title Collecta is almost always omitted, but it makes an
appearance on fol. 77 a. By insertion (b) of a letter, as ‘perficiant’ sor ‘perficiat' (sol. 27 a). By repe-
tition (c) oi a syllable, as ‘dis dispensationis’ (iol. 15 b); os a word, as ‘diebus’ (fol. 287 a); os two
words, as ‘tui fideles’ (sol. 27 a); of three words, as ‘ut propitiatus absolue' (fol. 24 a). By trans-
position (d) of letters, as ‘lugeant' sor ‘ uigeant' (sol. 156 b). By employment (e) of a wrong letter, as
‘quicquic' lor ‘quicquid’ (fol. 251 b); of a wrong syllable, as ‘quinis' sor ‘zonis’ (fol. 277 b); ol
a wrong word, as ‘gregem’ lor ‘ reginam’ (sol. 37 3 b); oi a wrong numeral, as vii ior viii (sol. 44 a);
of a wrong title, as on fol. 371 a, where an extract from the Epistle to the Hebrews is entitled
‘Lectio ad Romanos.’

Very occasionally the scribe has discovered his own mistake, and marks his discovery by placing
a¹ dot or dots beneath the error, on one occasion (sol. 20 a) writing the word ‘nota,’ which he spells
‘tona’ perpendicularly on the margin. The MS. text has been accurately copied, ‘even at the cost
of intelligibility‚ as where (fol. 44 a) the scribe has written ‘Maia generoi ' ior ‘Maius Agenorei’ (B),
but the proper reading has been, in a few os the more important cases, suggested in a footnote.

The preceding remarks apply in the main to the whole volume. It is necessary to describe
separately the three clearly marked off portions which constitute the complete Missal.

ξ 12. Leofric A, which is at once the most ancient and the largest ol the component parts ol

the Leohic Missal occupying 262 out of 377 leaves, is a Gregorian Sacramentary‚ written in Lotha-

ringia early in the tenth century.

p 13. In printing another copy ol this Sacramentary it may be convenient to prefix a list ol
those which already exist in type, and to add some notice of other MSS. which have not been
printed throughout, but of which partial use has been made in printed editions.
