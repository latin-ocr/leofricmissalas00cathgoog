read by the deacon and subdeacon at High Mass, and which were usually contained in the
separate volumes known as the Antiphonarium, Epistolarium‚ and Evangeliarium. The priest
was not bound then, as now, to repeat them privately, and if he was so bound, the mere catch·
words would have been insufficient for the purpose, unless he was endowed with almost superhuman ··
powers of memory. They are possibly handy references to the various volumes in which those
parts of the service, which are printed in extenso in the modern ‘Missale Plenarium,' were theu
separately contained.

A comparison of Leofric A with the Roman and Sarum Missals has been carried out
only as far as the ‘Missae Dominicales' and the ‘Proprium Sanctorum’ are concerued. The
minutiae would occupy too much space to print, but the result may be approximately summed
up thus :-

Of entire Missae, one is retained in R only, six are retained in S only, fourteen are
represented in neither R nor S.

It is almost superfluous to call attention to the Missa in natale S. Gregorii Papae (March 12,
p. 139); and to the wording of a Collect on p. 229, where St. Gregory’s prayers are
