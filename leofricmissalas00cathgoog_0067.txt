lx 1111111101.

We may assign the year 970, with some degree 01 certainty, as the date of this batch of manu·
missions, identifying the Ordgar who is mentioned as manumitting in them, with the Ealdorman
of Devonshire of that name who died in 971.

Ordgar was not an uncommon name in the tenth and eleventh centuries, but the
only other two prominent persons named ordgar, who might otherwise possibly be the Ordgar
named in the text, may be dismissed from consideration sor the following reasons. Ordgar, whose
floruit was from 900-926, is certainly too early. Ordgar ‘minister,’ ‘miles’ ‘ nobilis? who is first
mentioned in 1031, and who continues to sign down to 1049, is not known to have been connected
with any 01 the places named in the text, nor were they the property 01 any of the Ordgars
(Orgarus) mentioned more than once in the Exeter Domesday Book as holding land in Devon,
Somerset‚ and Oxon in the time of Edward the Confessor.

On the other hand, there are the following reasons for identiiying the Ordgar 01 the text with
the important person variously described as ‘Ealdorman¹‚' ‘Dux Domnaniae ξ’ ‘Comes Domnoni·
ensis ³,' whose daughter AElfthryth (Elfrida) married, as second wife, King Edgar, and whose
gigantic son, Ordulf, ‘Dux Comubiae⁴,’ is reported to have once treated the gates 01 the city of
Exeter in the same way as Samson treated those of Gaza¹⁵ :-

(a) Nearly all the placesnamed in the text are situated either in West Devon or in Cornwall,
where the territorial influence of Ealdorman Ordgar is known to have lain. The Devonian places are
grouped round Tavistock, where Ordgar founded the famous abbey in 961, in which, according to
one account, he was buried in 971, and which was completed by his son Orduli in 981 ⁶.

(6) According to another tradition, which cannot be traced to a very early source, Ordgar was

buried at Trematon Castle in Comwall, one of the places mentioned here in these manumissions
effected for Ordgarl.

(c) The Ordulf whose obit is entered at Dec. 16 in the Leofric kalendar may be the son 01
this Ordgar. The name of Ordgar’s wife has not been recorded. It is just possible that we have
it here in ‘Eadgyfu'

(d) These manumissions are entered onan isolated leaf, dislocated from its original position,
and in an earlier and more faded handwriting than ihat 01 the manumissions at the commencement
and close 01 the volume.

I have not been able to identify the ‘Birhtric', or Bryhtric, named as manumitting at Coryton

and Tywamhale. Brictric‚ or Brictricius, was the name 01 more than one person mentioned in ,

Domesday as holding land in Devon and Comwall, T. R. E. The obit of a ‘Brihtricus Decanus'
will be found on Feb. 16 in the kalendar, and 01 3 Byrhtric on April 3.

On fol. 11 a(p. 8) there is another Anglo·Saxon entry, 01 which the following is a translation :-

‘ These are the men who are made sureties between Eadgyfu the abbess and Leofric the
abbot, respecting the land at Stocton [=Stoke Canon], Wulfsig, Edwig, and Cytel, and Denisc,
and Godwin, and Hunwin, and Swete, and Edwig Bow, and Brown the priest, that the abbot should
have it for his day, and that after his day [it should go] to the minster.’

The minster mentioned in this passage must undoubtedly be that 01 Exeter, where we know, on
independent grounds, that there was both a monastery and a nunnery, and that property at Stoke
belonged to them ⁸. It is also evident that this paragraph must have been written before the
