mainlya miscellaneous collection of Masses, with all their component parts sometimes exhibited
at length, as in a modern Missal, but too fragmentary in the character and number of such
Masses to deserve the name of a Missal by itself.

The whole MS. remained the property of the Dean and Chapter of Exeter till 1602,
when, through the influence ol their fellow·county-man Sir Thomas Bodley‚ then engaged in
founding the Library which bears his name, it was presented, along with eighty other MSS,
to the University of Oxford. A list of those MSS. is contained in the Registrum Benefactorum
(p. 42), where this Missal is entered simply as ‘Missale antiquissimum? It will not surely be
thought uncomplimentary or ill-natured to expressa regret that both Leofric's Missals were
not given to the Bodleian Library at that time, for its companion book, the second of the ‘ii iulle
maesse bec’ previously mentioned, is temporarily, if not irrecoverably lost.

What has become of it? lt was believed once to be in the possession of Mr. Bourscough,
Vicat of Totnes, and Archdeacon of Bamstaple, ob. 1709. Among the list of his MSS. at
ὼε close of the seventeenth century this entry occurs :-

‘7⁶⁶3’ 44. Liturgia antiqua eadem, ut videtur, quam Leofricus Episcopus dedit ecclesiae
S. Petri Exoniensi. Bemard's Catalogue, A. D. 1697, p. 233!

In 1705 Wanley, after a description of the present Missal, adds :-

‘Alter autem nunc est peculium Rev. et doctissimi viri D. R. Bourscough, Rectoris ecclesiae
de Toteness in agro Devoniensi.’ (Thesaurus, p. 82.)

But there are substantia] reasons for supposing that both Bernard and Wanley were mistaken,
and that the MS. to which they refer is a Collectaneum, now in the British Museum, Harl.
MS. 2961. lt is certain that the last-named MS. once belonged to Bourscough, from the fact
that on the ily-leaf is written, in Wanley’s handwriting‚ ι7, May 1715,' which, as appears from
his Library Diary, was the day when the MSS. purchased from Bourscough's widow were brought
into Lord Oxford’s Library, and marked by Wanley with that date to distinguish them from
other parcels.

The following considerations make it almost certain that this MS. is the ‘Liturgia Antiqua
eadem, ut videtur, quam Leofricus,’ etc„ of Bemard's Catalogue. That description was probably
fumished to Bernard by Bourscough himself, and in its hesitating phraseology, we may detect
either a real uncertainty as to the proper way of describing a rather rare form of Liturgical MS,
or an antiquary's desire to make a little overmuch ol a possession on which he prided himself.
Now one and one only such MS. is mentioned in the printed Catalogue as being in Bourscough's
possession· One only is also mentioned ina letter, written by Bourscough to Wanley in June
1702, giving notice that he had just sent off from Totnes a parcel containing his Saxon MSS,
under care, to Richard King of Exeter, [who had previously been go-between between Wanley and·
Bourscough, see Harl. MS. 3778. fol. 3], ior that antiquary's inspection. In this letter he says :-

‘ 1 put a great value upon the old Liturgy, and therefore I desire you not to let it go out of your
hands till you return it with the rest.’ (Harl. MS. 3778 fol. 3.)

Harl. MS. 2961 contains two rather illegible notes on fol. 1 a, which afford very satisfactory
reasons for concluding, both that its original home was Exeter, and that it was one of Me MSS.
presented by Leofric to his cathedral, while it is known that it afterwards was in Mr. Bourscough’s
hands before it became the property of Lord Oxford.

The first note runs thus :—

‘ Hunc librum dedisse ecclesiae D. Petri [Exoniensi] apparet ex praefatione sermonis in die Paschae
Saxonice et Anglice, procurante M. Parkero archiepiscopo cantuariensi, Londini editi, ubi extat
catalogus librorum a Leofrico datorum, Sedulium et Persium dedit, et Boe[tium de Consol]atione,
Saxonice [eto] Ibi constat dedisse .i. winter raeding boc cum aliis.’
