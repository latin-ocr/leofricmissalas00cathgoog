byshoppe of Exeter lyeth here.’ Some account must be added of Leofric’s character and policy.
At first sight one would imagine that as a foreigner, at least in education and habits, he would
incur a share of the popular odium which attached to the foreign favourites introduced by Edward
into high ecclesiastical positions in England. But Edward’s foreign appointments can be
divided into two classes. In the first place there were cases of the appointment of Frenchmen
from Normandy, who were the King’s favourites‚ but objects of hatred to the English people.
Conspicuous among this class of nominees were Robert, Abbot of Jumieges, appointed t0 the
See of London in 1044, and translated to the Archiepiscopate of Canterbury in 1051 ; William, one
of the king's Norman chaplains‚ made Bishop of London in 1051: and Ulf, another Norman
chaplain, elevated to the Bishopric of Dorchester in 1049. All of these prelates fled from England
for sear of their lives, before the national reaction 0f feeling which took place in 1052. But there
was a second class of foreign appointment, in which the favoured nominees came not from
Normandy but from Lotharingia, a term which corresponds geographically to the South Nether-
lands, or to Belgium, and part of Germany west of the Rhine, and the French and German
provinces 0f Flanders‚ Picardy, Artois, Alsace, and Lorraine; ecclesiastically, to the province of
Cambray, including the dioceses of St. Omer, Toumay, Artas, Cambray, Namur; the northern
part of the province of Rheims, including the dioceses of Soissons‚ Amiens, Laon; the province of
Treves including the dioceses of Treves, Meta, Verdun, and Toul; the southern part of the
province of Mechlin‚ including the dioceses of Antwerp, Bruges, Ypres‚ and Ghent; and the
western part of the province of Cologne, including the dioceses of Cologne and Liege. This
district formed a borderland between France and Germany; in which both languages were
spoken, but‘ where German preponderated over French, and the inhabitants of which were
more akin than the French to the inhabitants of this country. The appointment of a Lotharin-
gian was therefore by no means the same thing as the appointment of a Norman to any post of
honour or emolument in England. Nor were such appointments confined to Edward the confessor.
We may include among the more conspicuous instances of such appointments those of-

(a) Duduc, made Bishop of Wells by Canute, in 1033, whom Florence of Worcester describes
as of Lotharingian origin ¹, but whom his successor, Gisa, declared to be of Saxon nationalityt

(b) Hermann, a Lotharingian, chaplain to King Edward, made Bishop of Ramsbury in 1044.

(c) Leofric‚ a Lotharingian, chaplain of the King, made Bishop of Crediton in 1046.

‘ Not one of these Lotharingian bishops fled from his See, like their Norman brethren
in the Episcopate, in 1052 ³. But though these bishops were not obnoxious to the inhabitants
of their English dioceses on the score of their nationality, their appointment tended to the
de-insularization of the English Church, and to its assimilation to the continental Church in
the loss of national privileges and in an increased subserviente to the Papacy. We are glad

to believe the post mortem panegyric‚ preserved in this Missal‚ which states that Leofric was most ⁴

active in teaching, preaching‚ promoting church restoration, and in fulfilling all the other duties
of the Episcopate⁴. His generosity, and his title to be enumerated among the benefactore
of the diocese of Exeter, are undoubted. He recovered for St. Peter’s Minster much of its
alienated property, ‘il land aet Culmstoke, and il land aet Brancescumbe, and aet Sealtcumbe, and ᾔ
