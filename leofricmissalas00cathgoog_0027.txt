‘an inhabitant of the Comish portion of the diocese of Crediton,’ by Mr. Freeman1. The latter
interpretation seems to be the more probable; yet a person bearing the common Saxon name
of Leofric² cannot have been a Celt pure and simple, and ‘Britonicus’ can only imply that he was
born in what was actually or traditionally Celtic ground, or that at least on one side of his family
Celtic blood was flowing in his veins. But whatever may have been his birthplace, we know that
his youth was spent, and his education received in Lotharingia By residence he was therefore
a foreigner ³, and as such he must have corne in contact with Edward the Confessor during his
enforced absence from England, 1016-42, at the court of his cousin Robert the Devil, Duke of Nor-
mandy, who died in 1035, or of his infant cousin William‚ hereafter to be known as the Conqueror.

When Edward returned to England to assume the Crown in 1042, Leofric probably accom-
panied him in the capacity in which he is first introduced to us in history as ‘priest’ or ‘private
chaplain’ to the king ⁴. But further honours were soon showered upon him. The estate of .
Holcombe in Dawlish was conferred upon him ⁶. He wa's made Chancellor to the king ⁶. In
1046 the Bishopric of Crediton, which, since the death of Burhwold or Brithwold Bishop of St.
Germain’s, had comprised the two Sees of Devonshire and Cornwall, and which had become vacant
through the death of Living⁷‚ was offered to and accepted by him. Leofric sat as Bishop of
Crediton for four years, but in 1050 he procured the direction of the King, and the sanction of
Pope Leo IX, to transfer the headquarters of the See from Crediton to Exeter. The reason given
for the change, both in the letter written by Leofric, and borne by his priest Lantbert, to the Pope ⁸,
and also in the royal charter authorizing the transfer of the See ⁹, was the need of greater safety
from the attacks of pirates. The enthronization of Leofric in his new cathedral took place with
great pomp. The leading nobility and clergy of the realm were present, and formed a brilliant
throng through which the Bishop advanced, his right arm being supported by the King and his left
arm by Queen Edith ¹⁰.

After an Episcopate at Exeter of twenty-two years, Leofric died on Feb.1o, 1072, and was
buried in the crypt of the cathedral. The exact site of his grave is no longer known, and no
memorial stone marks it, although as late as 1419 there is this entry upon the fabric rolls of the
cathedral, ‘Pro scriptura lapidis Domini Leofrici, primi ecclesiae Exon. Episcopi ¹¹.’ In 1568 a
memorial to him was erected under the south tower consisting of an old altar slab of Purbeck
marble, with a canopy over it of the same material, with this inscription, ‘Leofricus the first
