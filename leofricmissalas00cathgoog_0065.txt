lviii innotuerim.

‘Sabbato ante palmas Domnus Papa elemosinam dat¹.' The Roman stations are named: ‘Ad
sanctam Mariam maiorem, Ad Lateranus, etc.².’ At the same time there are indications that
the Roman Ritual was foreign to and different from the Ritual of the Church for which this
part of the Missal was written. Such arc the order that seven lamps are to be litat 11 am.
on Good Friday, or two altar candles as the Ordo Romanus enjoinsz-

¹ . . . illuminentur lampades vii, uel ut alius ordo precipit, id est, Romanus, illuminentur duae
inde candelae ad ministerium ad altare ubi officium agitur³.'

The mention that it is the custom of the Roman Church to extinguish all lights between
noon and 3 pm. on Good Fridayz-

‘Notandum uero est quia in Romana ecclesia extinguitur totus ignis in hac feria, hora sexta,
et reaccenditur hora nona ⁴.’

The only allusione in the Leofric Missal to ecclesiastical colours are found here in the direction
that ‘casulae nigrae'are to be worn on Maundy Thursday⁵, and ‘uestes quadragesimales, scilicet
planetae fuscae,' on Good Friday⁶.

Among points worthy of notice is an order for the stealthy removal of a linen cloth from
under the Gospel Book on the altar 'during the· recital os the Passion on Good Friday, and
for the rending asunder of two linen cloths placed on the altar for that purpose at the
words ‘Partiti sunt uestimenta ⁷.'

§4o. Besides its liturgical offices Leofric C contains various documents ofa miscellaneous
character, ol some of which it is necessary to give 1 short description.

b 41. Anglo·Saxon entries of manumissione of serfs occur on'fols. 1ab, 8ab, 377 b. Those on
fols. 1ab and 377b have been printed more than once; the most recent and accurate reprint, together
with a translation, being found in Haddan and Stubbs’ Councils and Ecclesiastical Documents⁸.
They are, as to handwriting, of the same date, and may be assigned, on internal evidence, to the
reign of Edward the Confessor (1042-66)⁹. Those on fol. 8ab were printed by Mr. J. B. Davidson
as an Appendix to a Paper on Anglo-Saxon Boundaries, read before the Devonshire Association
for the Advancement of Science, vol. viii. 1876, p. 417. As that volume is not easily accessible,
and as th'e text as given here (pp. 5-6) has been added to ln some points, and differs in others
from the readings of Mr. Davidson, a translation is appendedr—
