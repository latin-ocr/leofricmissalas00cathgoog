episcopate of Leofric in 1050, who expelled both monks and nuns, 3ηά instituted a body of secular
canons under strict, almost monastic rule, to serve the cathedral in their place. It is possible that
this Abbess Eadgyfu is identical with the lady of that name who is mentioned on fol. 8b (p. lix)
as manumitting over the territory of Ordgar, 3ηά who, as his widow, may afterwards have taken
the veil.

This part of the Missal‚ therefore, though partly written in the time of Leofric, must partly have
existed before his time, and have been added by him to those remaining portions of MS. which
have been already described, 3ηά which go to make up the complex volume which we speak of as
‘the Leofric Missal’

On page 6 there is a list of names of persons, living and departed, who were probably specially
prayed for in the eleventh century. There is a foreign ring about them, and their insertion may be
due to Leofric himself. The list includes the names of two bishops, Madalbertus and Odolgarius.
There was a bishop of the former name at Paris, in the middle of the eighth ¹, and a bishop
Odogarius at Spires in the middle of the tenth, century ², but there are not sufficient data for their
identification with the persons named in the text.

b 42. On pp. 1-2 a there is a lengthy statement to the effect that in MD. 905 Pope Formosus
wrote to King Edward, complaining of the paucity of bishops in Wessex, and threatening his male-
diction unless more sees were created. A synod was consequently held under the presidency os
Plegmund, Archbishop of Canterbury, and seven bishops were shortly afterwards consecrated on one
day to fill seven sees. The names of the bishops and their sees are given. One incidental allusion
to the unruliness of the Comish church throws light on the state of independence which it possessed
before it became thoroughly subject to Anglo·Saxon rule ³. Two later MS. copies of this document
are in existence ⁴, and its substance is repeated by William os Malmesbury⁶, who probably had the
Leofric copy before him as he wrote. Its contents have been by common consent (as far as their
details go) branded as unhiston'cal. The anachronism with which it commences is sufficient to
discredit it, Pope Formosus having died in 896, five years before the accession of Edward, and nine
years before his alleged letter to that king ⁶.

This document is closely followed by another, also to be assigned to quite the latter part of the
eleventh century, describing the transference of the see of Crediton, including both Devon and
Cornwall, by Bishop Leofric 3ηά Edward the Confessor, with papal sanction, to Exeter‚ in Ah). 1050.
The letter of Pope Leo IX to the king is given in extenso, and is followed hyan account of the
action taken in consequence; of the enthronization of Leofric at Exeter; of his generosity to the
see, andos his death on Feb. 10, 1071-27.

§43. On page 3 there is a long list of the relies, mostly given to the monastery of Exeter by
Athelstan, at its foundation by that king An). 932. A similar, but bynu means identical, list of
these relies is written in an earlier and an Anglo-Saxon handwriting, at the commencement of an
Evangeliarium once given by Leofric to the cathedral of Exeter, but now in the Bodleian Library
[Auct. D. ii. 16 fol. 83]. The latter list has been published with a Latin translation by Dugdale
[Monasticom ii. 528]. There is also a later MS. list preserved in the Cathedral Library at Exeter
[MS. 2861]. They were collected on the Continent for Athelstan by messengers sent abroad for
