, The following saints of the Celtic Church are also found ι·-

1. Jen. ²9· Gildas. of Britain. 5. June 28. Samson of Brittany.

a. Feb. 1. Bridget, of lreland. 6. Aug. ²⁴· Patrick. senior, of Ireland and Glas-
3. March 17. Patrick‚of1reland. tonbnry.

4. June aa. Alban of Britain. 7. „ 31. Aidan, of North Britain.

. Of this list, tradition says that (1) Gildas lived at Glastonbury¹; (2) St. Bridget visited
there² ; (3) Patrick was its first abbot³; (4) St. Aidan's relies were translated thither ⁴. In
addition to which Paulinus, Bishop of Rochester (Oct. 10), is said to have adorned its church⁶.

The evidence tends to the conclusion that the kalendar is to be connected with the monastery
of Glastonbury in the diocese of Wells.

There is no localizing connection with any other diocese, and, in the case of several adjoining
or neighbouring dioceses, the absence of names indicating such connection almost amounts to
anegative proof. It can hardly have belonged to the diocese of Ramsbury without mention
of Aldhelm as Abbot of Malmesbury3 or to that of Sherbome without mention of Aldhelm as
its bishop3 or to that of Dorchester without mention of Birinus; or to that of Winchester without
mention of St. Swithun3 while the references connecting it with the diocese of Crediton are
all of later date ⁶.

lt is impossible to fix the exact date at which it left its first home, to become eventually
the property of Leofric, and be bound up by him along with his Arras Sacramentary.

It should be added that among the home bishops whose obits or commemorations have
been added by later hands are :-

And the Celtic bishops:-

Fol. 43 b. Maglorius, Oct 25. Bishop of Dol in Britteuy. †c. 586.
F0¹·44e AErchus‚Nov. 2. Bishop of Slanein Irelnud †513.

The insertion of this last name is curious. Possibly as a friend of St. Patrick and St. Bridget
he had some mythical connection with Glastonbury. The preponderance of F rench or
Lotharingian saints among the continental names of saints in this supplementary list ⁸, suggests
that many of the additions are due to Leofric himself or his companions. Three bishops
of Maestricht are added on July 16, to a kalendar which already contained the names of two
· bishops of that See, viz. in the original kalendar :-

Feb. 6. Amandus. Bishopof Maestricht. †6s4. Ι Sep.17. Lambert Bishopof Maestricht. †l09.
