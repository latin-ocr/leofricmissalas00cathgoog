4. The English Litany on p. 205 includes the petition:

‘Ut regem Anglorum et exercitum eius conseruare digneris’

5. The expressions ‘regi nostro atque reginae,' ‘rex noster et regina,’ etc, occur in a Mass
on p. 251.

6. On p. 267 there is a ‘Missa pro rege uel pro regina,' in which prayer is offered lor

‘Regem nostrum famulamque tuam gregem'[=reginam].

To these we must add the alterations introduced by the eleventh·century English hand
into the older text ol A, viz. in the ‘Missa pro regibus,’ nn sol. 216b‚ where the plural, ‘reges’
is throughout changed to the singular, ‘rex,' and ‘Romanum’ into ‘Christianum3’ and ina
‘Missa pro amico’ on fol. 231b, where ‘rex noster famulaque tua regina’ is twice inserted
between the lines.

There is a marked difference between this phraseology and that which has been quoted as
occurring in A¹. The mention os a king and queen only, and the implication that they are

childless, point to Leosric’s great friend and patron Edward the Confessor and his wise
Queen Edith.

§38. Locality os Leosric C. In addition to the indisputable palaeographical evidence and
to the above allusions to English royalty, a few more evidences ol the Anglican character os
C may be adduced.

(α) Its list os additional services² includes three Messes connected with the British or
English Church,—St. Alban, protomartyr ol Britain, † 304 ; St. Cuthbert, Bishop oi Lindissarne,
†685; and the ordination os St. Gregory (March 29); while strong Gallican influence is still
visible in the addition oi St. Giles (Sept. 1); the Translation (July 4), and the Octave (Νον. 20),
os St. Martin; SS. Dionysius, Rusticus, Eleutherius (Oct. 9), St. Lazarus, legendarily connected
with Marseilles (Aug. 18).

(b) The mention ol St. Peter and St. Swithun in the next passage appears to point to both
Exeter and Winchestert—

‘Familiam beatissime Dei genitricis Mariae, necnon et sancti Petri apostoli, atque sancti
Swithuni confessoris Christi . . . custodi’ (p. 12).

Another Mass includes expressions which prove that it can only have been used at Exeter,
and that it was composed by or lor Bishop Leoiric himself. They are part os a ‘Missa propria
pro Episcopo,' on p. 20.

In the Collect:

‘Quique me famulum tuum ,ilc non meis meritis, sed dono tuae gratiae, pontificali cathedra
Exoniensium sublimasti . . .’

In the Secreta:

‘.. . me famulum tuum, quem Exoniensium uoluisti esse antistitem, et populorum, quem

instituendum lege preceptorum tuorum mihi commendasti, hac sacri mysterii oblatione a pec-
catis emunda. . .’

ln the Postcommunion:

‘Inplor0, Domine Deus, ut me famulum tuum quem sancte Exoniensi aecclesiae preesse
uoluisti, et agnos tuos quos tibi ex uniuersali aecclesia specialius electos, mihi nutriendos
commisisti . . .’ '

q 39. The very lull offices sor Palm Sunday, Maundy Thursday, and Good Friday, pp. 255-
262, are ol a foreign stamp. They are oi Roman origin, modified perhaps in Lotharingia, and
introduced by Leosric into England. The office for blessing palms opens with this statement:
