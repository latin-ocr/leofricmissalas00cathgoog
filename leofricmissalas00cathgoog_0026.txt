51. THE MS. volume, now presented for the first time in extenso, has long been known to
liturgica] writers, and has been frequently quoted by them under the title of‘The Leofric Missal.'
It is so called from its having been the property 01 Leofric¹ first bishop of Exeter, and by him
presented to Exeter Cathedral. Its liturgical interest lies in the fact that it is one 01 the only
three surviving Missals known to have been used in the English Church during the Anglo-Saxon
period, its companion volumes being the Missal 01 Robert of Jumieges‚ Archbishop of Canterbury‚
written in the first half of the eleventh century, and now in the Public Library at Rouen, [MS.Y.6],
and the ‘Rede Boke 01 Darbye,’ written in the second half of the eleventh century, now in the
Library of Corpus ChristinCollege, Cambridge ². [Nasmith's Catalogue‚ Νο. 411]

52. Considerable uncertainty hangs over certain points connected with the life 01 Leofric.
The exact place and date of his birth are unknown. Inett calls him a Burgundian ³. Dr. Oliver is
a little more circumstantial, and describes him as ‘descended from an illustrious family in
Burgundy⁴;’ but¹ as neither of these writers give any authority 101 their statements‚ and as
evidence can be produced which is inconsistent with them, the Burgundian theory may be dismissed
without further notice. Florence of Worcester calls him ‘Britonicus⁵,’ a word which has been
interpreted to mean ‘a Breton,' or native of Brittany, by Mr. Pedler⁶, and Professor stubbs⁷, and
