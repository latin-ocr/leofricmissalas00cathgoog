iuraturos. xxix

This proposed identification of Harl. MS. 2961 with the ‘winter raeding boc' is erroneous, as that
MS. implies the continuance of offices throughout the year.

The second note, at the foot of the same page, is :-

‘Nactus sum hunc librum Exoniae‚ ego Samuel Canutus in coemeterio Divi Petri. Extant frag-
menta subscripsionis Saxonic[e] in laceris extremi folii reliquiis, quibus opinor testatum fuit
Leofricum eundem donasse!

This ‘Canutus’ is Dr. Samuel Knott, rector of Combe Raleigh in Devon, 1661-1698‚ a diligent
collector of MSS, which afterwards came into Mr. Bourscough's possession. The torn remains of
the last leaf no longer exist, but Leofric's habit of writing an inscription at the beginning or end of
his volumes is in favour of the correctness of Dr. Knott‘s suggestion.

The following isan extract from a letter written by Mr. Robert Bourscough on Dec. 31 [year not
stated, and not addressed]‚ Smith MS, No. 25, which is a collection of MS. Letters bequeathed to
Thomas Hearne by the Rev. Thomas Smith‚ D.D.‚ Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford :-

‘ . . . For several years I have not been at Exeter, but I have thoughts of going thither in the
spring, and, ifl may be permitted to take a catalogue of the MSS. in the Cathedral Library, 1
shall most willingly communicate it to you, and be glad of the opportunity of serving you. In the
preface to a Saxon piece of the abbot AEIfric, concerning the sacrament of the Body and Blood of
Christ, published by Archbp. Parker‚ which I doubt not but you have seen, we are informed that
many books of that nature were reserved in the libraries of Worcester, Hereford, and Exeter, from
which places divers of them were delivered into the hands of the said archbishop, but that they
were restored doth not there appear. . . .’

In another letter he says :—

‘. . . I have 2 MSS. Latin Bibles, in both which 1 find these words: Tres sunt qui testimonium .

dant in caelo, Pater, Verbum, et Spiritus Sanctus, et hii tres unum sunt, etc, Joh. i. 5, 7. And in
prologues that are in both those manuscripts the genuine reading is asserted. 1 have also a MS.
Liturgy in which these words occur, and are cited as a part of Scripture: Tres sunt qui testimonium
etc, as before. This Liturgy was written about 600 years ago, and as I have good reason to think,
this very book was given by Leofrick the first bishop of Exeter to the church of S. Peter at Exeter.¹
Letter to the same. Ib. No. 28. Undated.

Now this passage (1 Joh. v. 7) does not occur in the Leofric Missal, nor is it likely to have ,
occurred in any missal of the same date as the Leofric Missal, but it does occur in the Collectarium
(Harl. MS. 2961) as the chapter for Terce on Trinity Sunday. Fol. 108 b.

The inevitable deduction from all these facts is that the identification of Leofric's second Missal
with the Liturgical MS. once in Mr. Bourscough’s possession must be abandoned.

We subjoin an account of the principal orthographical peculiarities of the Leofric Missal, append-
ing either the letters A, B, C, or the folio in each case, to enable the reader to ascertain whether
they belong to the English or the Lotharingian part of it, and reserving other points, such as the
ornamentation, etc, to be described separately hereafter‚ with that part of the Missal to which they
belong.

Μ. Accents. A single accent (') is employed occasionally and capriciously throughout the
volume, most frequently over monosyllables‚ but occasionally over longer words. The same mark
is sometimes used, especially in the canon of the mass (A) and in C, to mark a long syllable, or to
show where the accent is to fall, evidently for the sake of priests whose pronunciation could not be
trusted. The double accent (⁶) appears occasionally over a double vowel oblft, (B), Aaron (A C).

po. Punctuation. The only stop in regular use throughout A and B is the low or middle

point (. or ·), but the mark of interrogation (ἒ) puts in a rare appearance, and the following stop (·;)
appears occasionally, singly‚ doubled‚ or trebled, at the end of titles in A, and a solitary semi-
