All these saints are connected with the north of France, and most of thern with that district
of Lotharingia in which Leofric was brought up ¹.

(c) The elevation of St Martin, alone of local sainte, into the second class of dignified
festivals ¹. ·

(dyThe Mass for the Translation of St. Benedict, on July 11. This Mass doen not occur
in the present Roman Missal, or in any of the older Roman Sacramentaries. lt was the Mass
of a popular Gallican Festival, transferred to England probably in the tenth century ³.

(e) The Missae for the three Rogation Days between the fifth Sunday after Easter and
Ascension Day ⁴. The Laetania maior was a Roman institution, and kept on April 25. The
three Rogation days were a Gallican institution, and would not be part of a Roman Sacramentary
except by importation from a foreign source, before their introduction into Rome by Leo 111
(79 5-816). Much stress cannot therefore be laid upon their presence in Sacramentaries subsequent

to that date ⁵.

(f) There is a class of phrases, used in prayersfor the chief ruler of the country in which
a Missal has been written, which it is dangerous to press too far, unless the emperor or king
in question is actually named, which unfortunately is the exception, and not the rulet The
following expressions, taken together, indicate that Leofric A was written within the limits of
the Roman empire, and probably within the French domains of Charles the Simple (893-929)

or Lewis IV (936-954).
(1) ‘Suscipe oblationem . . . pro rege nostro et sua uenerabili prole' (p. 9).
(2) ‘Oremus et pro christianissimo (uel christiano) imperatore nostro .ill.‘ (p. 95).

(3) On p. 97 the original phrase has been carefully erased, and a later hand has substituted
‘et archiepiscopo nostro atque rege nostr0,’ for (probably) ‘imperatore nostro! The alteration
seems to have been made after the book had come to England, and the reference may be
to King Edward the Confessor and the Archbishop of Canterbury.

(4) On p. 179 the following phrases occur in the original MS, in each case altered by the
later English hand in the way here denoted between brackets :—
‘Romanum imperium (uel Christianum).'
‘Famulis tuis principibus nostris (famulo tuo regi nostro).'
‘Famulus tuus ,ill (rex noster).’
(5) ‘Regem nostrum, cum coniuge et natis eius . . . conseruare digneris' (p. 207).

If conjecture may be hazarded, the reference may be to Lewis IV, †954‚ his wife Gerberga,
and his sons Lothaire and Charles.

(6) ln the Litany on p. 211 : ‘Ut reges nostros et exercitum eorum conseruare digneris!

(7) From ‘Orationes pro regnantibusr’-
‘Romanorum regum tibi subditorum protege principatum' (p. 230).
‘Romani regni adesto principibus' (Ιό.)
‘Romani imperii auxiliare principibus' (In).
