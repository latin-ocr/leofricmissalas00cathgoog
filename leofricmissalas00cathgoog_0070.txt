Ascension, Pentecost, Holy Trinity, Holy Cross, Feasts oi Apostles, sor the dead. The letter has
been printed by most oi the mediaeval ritualists¹, and has been accepted as genuine by Baronius²,
Binius³, etc, but its spurious character has been pointed out by Cardinal Bona ⁴, Merati⁶, Labbe
and Cossart ⁶, etc, and it is now generally believed to be the composition oi some unknown person
in the tenth or eleventh century.

h 46. The tripartite character oi this MS. has involved so lengthy an introduction‚ that many
points oi minor interest which present themselves ior remark must be passed over in silence, and
the editor must be content to provide others with a wealth os Liturgical material to which reference
may be made, or from which information may he drawn, on many points connected with the ancient
services os the Church os England.

But it may be permitted, in conclusion, to summarize a lew points in the Ritual, Discipline, or
sorm os Liturgy, as represented by the Leofric Missal, which are now obsolete in the Roman, and.
with one exception ⁷, in the Anglican communion. · ·

h 47. A ‘missa in pascha annotina' is inserted between Low Sunday (Dic Octabas Pascha)
and the Second Sunday aster Easter (Dom. 1 post Oct. Pasch.) ⁸.

This ‘Pascha annotinum,’ kept on or near Low Sunday, denoted the solemn and public
renewal oi their baptismal vows on the part ol those who had been baptized at Easter-tide in the
preceding year ⁹. From the rubric in the margin it seems to have been a fixed day which might
fall in Lent. The rubric is written in the later hand, and shows that the ceremony had not become
obsolete in the eleventh century in England ¹⁰.

§48. An ‘ordo agentibus publicam poenitentiam’ on Ash Wednesday page 73, and an ‘ordo
ad reconciliandum,’ page 92, on Maundy Thursday, exhibit the ritual which accompanied the public
exclusion from church ol penitents on the first day os Lent, and their sormal reconciliation on
Thursday in Holy Week ¹¹.

h 49. The practice os communicating people as well as priest, in both kinds, is evidenced by
the language which occurs in various collects, e. g.—

‘Cuius calesti mysterio pascimur et potamur ¹²)

‘Ipsi qui sumimus communionem huius sancti panis et calicis ¹³.'

‘Cuius carne dum pascimur roboramur, et sangnine dum potamur abluimur ¹⁴.'

‘Illius agni cibo satiemur et poculo ¹⁵.’

‘Reiecti cibo potuque caelesti ¹⁶.’

‘Repleti alimonia caelesti et spiritali poculo, etc. ¹⁷!

The consecrated contente oi the chalice were generally administered to the peoplc through a
metal reed or pipe. The silver pipe mentioned among the donations os Bishop Leoiric was
probably used ior this purpose ¹⁸.
