13. While admiring the assiduity and generosity 01 the first bishop 01 Exeter‚ we must
also note his tendency and determination, in common ,with other foreigners intruded about
the same time into English Sees‚ to Romanize the Church 01 England. Roman in origin,
owing her existence to 1130 lorethought 01 030 01 11ιο greatest 01 Popes, and sostered at first by
Roman missionaries and bishops, the Church 01 England had been consistently and loyally
Roman in doctrine 3ηά practice. Her first liturgical books, as well as vestments and church
ornaments, came direct 13033 Rome, being sent by Gregory to Augustine ¹. Her archbishops
from the very first applied 103 3331 wore the palli. But along with a just and ready recognition
01 1303 310131 10 Rome, she had retained, till 1130 reign 01 Edward the Confessor, certain privileges
and notes 01 autonomy, which are necessary to the independent 1110 01 3 33110331 Church. For
example in the 01001103 01 bishops. Up to the time oi Edward the Church 01 England kept this
matter in her own hands. The mode 01 01001103 resembled that prevailing in the Anglican
rather than in the Roman Church 01 the present day. The chapter, the witenagemot, and the king
all took their part; but the appointment, virtually, and under ordinary circumstances, was a royal
030, auditis the king who is most frequently described as giving a bishopric to this or that
royal nominee: but in the eleventh century we hear 103 the first time 01 bishops going to
Rome 103 consecration or confirmation, and 01 the Roman court claiming at least a veto on
the nomination 01 1130 English king ³. Or take the question 01 033031331103. 13 1130 0331103
Anglo-Saxon Church this power was exercised by the provincial bishops and national councils,
the first instance 01 solemn canonization by a pope being that 01 Ulric, Bishop 01 Augsburg,
by John XV in 993, while the privilege was reserved exclusively 10 1110 Roman See by
Alexander III in 1170. Thus the two Saxon brothers, priests, and martyrs, Hewald the Swarthy
and Hewald the Fair, were canonized by the English Church soon 31103 their death circ. 695⁴.
