’ , PREFACF..

Tus object of the publication of this volume is to render generally accessible '
the text of the Liturgy of the Church of England during the Anglo-Saxon period.
The Liturgy of the Anglo-Norman period has been popularized by recent reprints
. of the Sarum, York, and Heresord Missals. With the Leofric Missal before him,
a student will ‚now be able to trace the alterations and modifications which gradually
took place in the text of the Canon and in the structure of Masses. The almost entire
absence of rubrics from the Leosric, in common with all early Sacramentaries, will
unfortunately prevent him from ascertaining how far the peculiar directions of the later
Uses as to the position and manual acts of the priest‚ the sequence of colours, and other
ritual details, are of mediaeval origin, or a perpetuation of earlier English usage.

ln the course of publication the Editor has become indebted to many known, and
