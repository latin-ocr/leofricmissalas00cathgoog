“ St. Swithun is usually honoured, as in the Anglo-Saxon Missal at Rouen, with three festivals,
July 2, the Deposition; July 15, the Translation; Oct. 30, the Ordination. Bede is mentioned on
101. 543, but did not early obtain a place in the Kalendar ¹. Other names, constantly found
in later English Kalendars, are necessarily absent from an early tenth-century MS. like
Leofric B, e. g. Nov. 20, Edmund‚ King and Martyr, †870; March 18, Edward, King and Martyr,
†978; Aug. 1, St. Ethelwold, Bishop, †984; May 19, St. Duustan, Archbishop, †988; April. 19,
St. Alphage‚ Archbishop, †1o12, etc.

There are 00 local ‘Dedicationes Ecclesiae’ connected with England. The commemoration on
May 13 refers to the dedication of the Pantheon at Rome to the B. V. M. by Pope Boniface IV,
608-615.

§gu The following features are worthy of separate notice, as connected with the antiquity
of the Kalendar:- ’

Jan. 10. St. Paul the hermlt is commemorated here in-all the above Kalendars, instead of
00 Jan.15, to which date his commemoration has been shifted since the sixteenth century.

April 4. St. Ambrose is commemorated 00 April 4, the day of his death, in Anglo·Saxon
Kalendars, and in the Sarum, York, and Hereford Uses, instead of on Dec. 7, the ‘day ol his
ordination,’ as in the Roman Martyrology and Missal.

July 3. St. Martio. This day of his Ordination and Translation is marked in lieu of his
Deposition on Nov. 11, in most Anglo·Saxon Kalendars; but in addition to it in Galba, A. xiii3
Vitell. E. xviii; Tib. D. xxvii, and in the Uses of Sarum, York, and Hereford. This is not in the
present Roman Kalendar.

Sep. 24. Conception of St. John. This festival is frequent in Anglo-Saxon Kalendars, e. g.
Jun. 993 Digby, ⁶33 Douce, 2963 Galba, A. xviii; Vitell. E. xviii. It does not occur in the later
Uses of Sarum, York, Hereford, or in the Roman Missal.

June 3. St. Thomas the Apostle is not commemorated 00 this day in any of the above MSS.
or in later Uses.

June 13. St. Bartholomew. This day is marked as his Nativity in the Martyrology of
St. Jemme, but it does not occur in any of the above MSS. or later Uses. His translation is
entered against Oct. 25, by a later hand.

July 1. St. Jude. 'This is the day of his Passion in the Persian Kalendar, but it is not
marked in any of the above MSS. or later Uses.

The paucity of Octaves is to be noted, especially the absence of the Octave of the
Assumption of the B.V. M. which was instituted by Leo IV, in 847 ²; also the paucity of Vigils ³.
Vigils of all Feasts of St. Mary and the Apostles, except SS. Philip and james, were ordered
to be observed in England by a Witenagemot held under Ethelred in 1008 ⁴. They are ordered
again in the laws of Edward the Confessor, the Vigils of St. John Baptist, St. Michael, All Saints,
and the patron saint being added to the list of namesl.

Numerous and elaborate tables of calculation precede 3ηά follow the Kalendar, which have
an astronomical rather than a liturgica} importance. Their nature is briefly indicated in the table of
contents. A few notes have been appended explaining some of the abbreviations employed in the

text. The tables on fols. 53 a, 57 a, pp. 50, 56, and the obits 00 fol. 53 a, p. 50, are of great use in
helping to lix the date of the MS.
