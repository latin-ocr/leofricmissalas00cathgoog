July 11. Translation of St. Benedict. Ι Aug. 1. St. Peter’s Chains.

§18. Additzbns in a later hand to A. Apart from the somewhat extensive interpolations,
of whole pages and passages of Leofric C in Leofric A¹‚ the following must be noted as not
part of the original Sacramentary, but as added or altered by various English scribes after A

had been brought by Leofric into this country.
1. The marginal entries of Epistles and Gospels. These have been entered sometimes before,

sometimes after, the rest of the catchwords, never in their proper place. Sometimes they are
omitted altogether.

2. The marginal entries of the Sequenees in the few cases where they occur, as in the
Feriae post Pascha. .

3. The Alleluias placed between the Epistle and Gospel in some of the Missae in Easter-Tide.

4. The whole of the marginal entries on fols. 76 a, 77a, nab, 113 a, 123b, 129 b, 149 a, and
from fol. 204a (inclusive).

5. Certain alterations in the text of the Benedictio Cerei on fol.111ab.

§19. Rubrics and Tities in A. There is no Ordinarium Missae², and there are no Rubrics
in the Canon of the Mass; nor in the more strictly eucharistie portions of the Sacramentary3
but Rubrics of some length and importance are placed to regulate the ceremonial observances
of Aah Weduesday‚ Holy Week, etc, and in the Agenda Mortuorum, and other offices which occur
at the conclusion of the Missae Votivae. They are written ln red, very rarely in black, ink. Some·
times they are rather paragrapho giving information than Rubrics, as in the case of the lv. Coronati
(fol. 198 b).

The titles of Missae, and of their constituent parts, are written in rustic capitals‚ except from fol.
262-278b (inclusive), where uncial letters are substituted. They are written throughout in red ink.

With regard to their nomenclatore, the first Collect is mostly untitled, but the headings
‘Ad missam’ and ‘Collecta’ are employed very rarely. ‘Secreta‘ is more frequently used than
‘Super oblata ;' ‘Ad complendum' more frequently than ‘Postcommuni03’ ‘In fractione’ as fre·
quently as ‘Infra actionem3' but the two latter titles are very apt to get confused, and it may
be doubted whether ‘In fractione,' both here and elsewhere, is not always due to a clerical error.

later Missals.

The result of a comparison of Leofric A with other Sacramentaries is that of the 318 Masses
which it contains, 264 have been found wholly or partially in the Codex Vaticanus published
by Muratori, and of the remaining 54 Masses the following 15 have been found in the Codex
S. Eligii, as published by Menard³.
