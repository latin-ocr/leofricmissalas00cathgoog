§34 The third part ol the Missal consists ol a large quantity ol miscellaneous material
chiefly liturgical, which, lor convenience sake, is here grouped together under the title ol Leolric C.
The greater part ol it lies together at the beginning and close ol the volume, other portions
being scattered up and down the volume in'a way already described ¹.

It occupies eighty-six leaves of vellum, arranged in gatherings os eight leaves, not signed ²,
r'or the most part ol a finer and whiter skin than that employed in A. In many instances spare
pages or parts ol pages ol A have been covered by collects or benedictions, in one os the later
hands (245b, 1766), the older writing being in a lew instances erased lor the purpose (274a
278b).

Nearly thirty different handwritings may be distinguished, most ol them os a thoroughly
English character, but the partly Lombardic type os letters which appears occasionally may betray
one ol the foreign attendants ol Bishop Leolric³. There are no prools that any one os them
is in the handwriting os Leolric himself ; but if we should expect to detect it anywhere‚ it would
be in the case os such a Missa as the ‘Missa propria pro episcopo’ (p. 20), which, by whomsoever
written, can only have been composed and used by a Bishop ol Exeter.

635. Omamenrarion. All titles and rubrics are written in red, the lormer in small rustic

capitals. The initial letters vary from hall an inch to an inch in height. On and alter lol. 18a,
the first, third, fifth, etc, are light red, the intervening letters being light blue or light green.
The same quality and shade ol paint may be seen in the other MSS. which were once presented
by Leolric to Exeter‚ and are. now in the Bodleian Library ⁴. The Amens on lol. 33b are
written in red. The last lew pages are unfinished, the coloured initial letters ceasing to appear
lrorn the bottom ol lol. 375 a.
