the date os a kalendar must be fixed between the date os the last saint entered prima manu,
and a date indicated by the character of its later obits. The latest saint commemorated in
the original Kalendar is St. Bonisace‚ who died in 755 (June 5). The obits, so sar as their
dates can be ascertained, cover ³. period from the death oi King Edgar in 976 (p. 50), to the

death of William the Conqueror in 1087. The one exception is the obit of Eadutt first
Bishop os Crediton, who died in 934 (p. 33); but its insertion may be an asterthought and
due to the same hand which inserted the obit os AElfwin, Bishop ol Wells, on p. 30 († 998).
A list oi other non-contemporaneous additions to the kalendar has been given on p. 1.

The tables for finding the date¹ oi Easter Day (p. 50) range from 969-1006‚ comprising
the fifty-second and fifty-third oi the Dionysian cycles os nineteen years, acquaintance with
which was popularized in England by Bede1. One or more oi these cycles was often appended
to a kalendar in its entirety2. There is no certain ground ior assigning the date os the writing
to the first year, but there are reasonable grounds ior assigning it to one os the years, and
probably to one os the earlier years, in the first cycle. ¹

Another and less usual table on p. 56 gives the number os weeks and days which
elapsed between Christmas Day and Ash Wednesday, from A. D. 979 to A.1>.1011.

Taking all these ioregoing facts into consideration we may assign the latter part ol the tenth
century as the date os Leofric B.

933. ὶοιαίίζγ os Leofric B. In addition to the unmistakeably Anglo-Saxon character oi
its handwriting and omamentation, the English character of this Kalendas is proved by (a) the
saints whom it commemoratesl, (b) by the illustrious persons whose obits it records‘, and (c)
by the following entry on p. 53 :-

‘Haec sunt ieiunia que sanctus Gregorius genti Anglorum predicare precepit.'

But it can be localized more narrowly, and ior this purpose we must confine our attention
to the original handwriting and leave out οἱ sight later entries and obite, which were inserted
aiter the kalendar had been taken to Crediton or Exeter.

It certainly was written in the province of Canterbury and not in that of York.

Three Archbishops of Canterbury are commemorated, as such :—

April 24, Mellitus; May 26, Augustine; September 19, Theodore.

Two bishops are commemorated who can claim connection with the See os York; but the
first appears expressly, and the second probably, in virtue of connection with a southern See :—

October 10, Paulinus, Bishop oi Rochester3 October 12, Wilfrid, Converter of Sussex.

The connection oi Samson (June 28) with York is legendary.

The names of one northern bishop and two northern abbots appear, but the second and
third expressly, and the first probably, in connection with a southern monastery, via:—

Jan. ra. Benedict,Fi1stAbbotoiWearmouth. Ι nug. 31. Aidnn, Bishop oi Lindisssme,inGlrestonia.
Sep. 25. Ceollrith, Second abbot ol Wearmouth, in Glaestonia.

William ol Malmesbury‚ or the author who passes under his name, states that abbot Tica brought the
relies oi these saints, along with others, to Glastonbury in 704 ⁶. We have thus, incidentally, a partial
tenth-century corroboration ol one oi the many wonderful stories told in later times about Glastonbury.

Two more northern bishops ol wide fame are added :—

March a. Chad, Bishopoi Lichfield. Ι March πο. Cuthbcrl, BishoposLindislnme.

The remaining saints connected with the Anglo·Saxon Church are irom mid or south
England, via:-

¹ Inter opera dubia Migne, Bib. Par. Lat. xc. ⁸43· ⁸ Pege xlix. ⁴ Pagae l-li.
¹ The same cycles occur in Βατιιω MS. Psalter, No. 150. ⁸ De Antiq. Glaston. Eccita.. Hennes edit p. ²9·
