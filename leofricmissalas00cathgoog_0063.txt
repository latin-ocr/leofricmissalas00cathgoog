With the single exception of the Mass for St. John the Baptist’s Day, which is probably an
occidental repetition, the above list is supplementary to Leofric A, and includes chiefly feasts
of much popularity in England, or a feast like the Conception of St. Mary (Dec. 1), instituted v
after Leofric A was written. ·

There are also thirty-four Common or Votive Masses, and a large number of isolated Collects,
Benedictions, PrefaceS, Apologiae Sacerdotis, etc, with full offices and ritual for Palm Sunday,
Maundy Thursday, and Good Friday (fols. 346 a-364 a).

8 37. Date os Leofric C. The colophon (fol. 1), entries of manumissione of slaves (pp. 1, 5, 6, 269),
statements about the transfer of the see from Crediton, etc. (p. a), the list of relies (p. 3), the
Mass for a bishop (p. ao), connect this part of the volume with Devon and Comwall, partly
before, partly during, the episcopare of Leofric, 1050-72, but the document on fol. aa was
evidently written after his death.

Other general indications of an elmenh-century date, orat least of a later date than that
of A, may be pointed out.

(a) The use of Sequences, which are introduced on seven occasions :-

Feria .11. in albis. Caelica resonent, fol.117a
‚, .111. „ Mater sequentiarum, fol. 117a¹.
‚, .1v. „ Claris uocibus, fol.118a.
„ ‚vn ,‚ Lira,fol.119b.
Sabbato „ Omnes sancti, fol. 120 a.
S. Mariae Magd. Scalam ad celos, fol. 339 b.
Coena Domini. Audi, iudex, fol. 354 a.

The invention os Sequences is referred to Notker a monk of St. Gall in 880. In the next
century they were introduced into England, where their use became so popular that it is a matter
of surprise that only seven have foundtheir way into the Leofric Missal².

(b) The Masses in C assume in many cases the complete form of Masses as contained in
a modern Plenary Missal, instead of the limited shape found in A, and in older Sacramentaries
(pp. 10, 252, etc).

(c) The Mass for the Conception of the B. V. M, on p. 268, implies a date later than the
institution os that festival in 1067 ³.

(d) The prayers for royalty include the following expressions :-

1. A 'benediction for a childless king:

‘Da de lumbis eius sobolem regnaturam’ (p. 9).

2. A prayer forali estates includes

‘Regem nostrum et reginam nostram' (p. 12).

3· A Missa pro Regina occurs on p. 20.
