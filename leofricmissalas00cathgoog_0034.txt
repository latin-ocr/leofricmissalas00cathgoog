It will be necessary, 101 the sake 01 cleamess, to describe A, B, C, separately, 11111 1 short
history 01 the volume as a whole. There ean be little doubt that Leofric brought (Α) with him
irom the continent, when, as seems probable, he accompanied Edward the consessor to England in
1042. He then procured a somewhat more recent Anglo-Saxon Kalendar (B), and in the exercise
01 that diocesan independence, which has only ceased to exist in modern times, he added to
it 1 selection 01 Masses (C), one at least 01 which was probably composed by himself ¹. He
then presented the compound volume to his new cathedral in his own lile-time, 11 we may

with the perfect ‘dedit' in the colophon 01 his Persius, which must have been 1111 to the canons
after his death². The Leosric Missal is almost certainly one 01 the two ι111111 messe bec'
enumerated among Leosric's gitts on p. xxii. We need not hesitate to interpret the term ‘tull
Mass book,’ still less the term ‘Missalem' in the colophon on the first page, 01 the Leoiric MS.
taken as 1 whole, although those terms would not apply to its parts regarded singly. A is
simply an old-sashioned Sacramentary or ‘Liber Sacramentorum.’ Bis onlya Kalendar. Cis
